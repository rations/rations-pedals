#
# Source art (resources/img, the author's own): head-base.png, cabinet-base.png,
# dial-base.png, led-on-base.png, led-off-base.png. The *-base.png files are the
# untrimmed exports and are deliberately NOT in the bundle's resource list —
# CMakeLists.txt ships the trimmed and generated results only. Overridable with
# ART_DIR / OUT_DIR.
#
# There is no badge step: the "Rations" wordmark is drawn as text in Michroma at
# run time rather than exported as a raster layer.
#
# The vector icons are NOT built here — they are small MIT SVGs committed to
# resources/img and rasterised at run time by NanoSVG. Set NAM_UPSTREAM to a
# checkout of NeuralAmpModelerPlugin (github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin,
# MIT) to refresh the five that come from it. Folder.svg is the author's own, and
# SlimmableIcon.svg is upstream's shape recoloured to this panel's palette — a
# derived file, so it is NOT refreshed by the loop below and a copy from upstream
# would silently put the sibling plug-in's azure back on this faceplate.

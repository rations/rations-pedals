# editor-drive.sh — open the plug-in's editor in the SDK's editorhost and drive it with real
# pointer input, so that what a control does when a human uses it can be checked rather than
# assumed.
#
# The editor is painted by hand into the host's own window and has no accessibility surface, no
# scripting hook and no test seam. The only way to find out whether clicking a bat switch changes
# a channel, or whether dragging a dial draws the readout where the art audit says it will, is to
# put a pointer on it and photograph the result. That is what this does.
#
# Three things here were expensive to learn and are the reason this is a script and not a one-liner:
#
#   * FIND THE WINDOW BY SIZE, never by title. Matching the plug-in's name against the window tree
#     also matches the terminal you are running from, because the project directory is in its
#     title — which silently hands back a shell window and photographs that instead.
#   * THE FIRST SYNTHETIC CLICK AFTER THE WINDOW MAPS IS SWALLOWED. Something in the embedding
#     handshake eats it. A control that "does not respond" to the first click responds to the
#     second, so a warm-up click is burned before anything is measured. Without it a working
#     control reads as broken and you go looking for a bug that is not there.
#   * `type` AND `key` NOW WORK, and they did not always. This host still never calls
#     IPlugView::onKeyDown — there is not one occurrence of it anywhere in editorhost's source —
#     so for as long as that was the plug-in's only route, a null result here said nothing about
#     the plug-in and the header said so. The editor now also reads keys from its own window while
#     a text field is open, which is what these commands exercise; the reasoning, and the terms
#     that keep the host's key commands out of it, are in RULES section 4.
#   * `type` HOLDS SHIFT where the layout needs it, so capitals and shifted punctuation are
#     typeable and testable. It asks the keyboard mapping which level a keysym sits on rather than
#     calling isupper(), which would be right for letters on one layout and wrong for symbols on
#     every layout. This matters: the field's own handler once rejected any key with a modifier
#     set, so a rig that could not press Shift could not have caught it.
#   * The channel-rename field is still the SECOND way to name a channel. The first is the
#     basename of whatever the channel loaded, which needs no keyboard and works everywhere,
#     including in hosts that decline to give an embedded view the focus.
#
#   * A DRAG HAS TO TAKE REAL TIME. The editor coalesces motion and repaints on a timer, and the
#     drag readout is only drawn while the button is held, so a screenshot has to be taken from a
#     second process while the drag is still in flight.
#
# The window size doubles as the page identity, since every page brings its own: head 1133x403,
# cabinet 640x460, pedalboard 662x681, settings 640x524 (at scale 1.0). So --size is both how the
# window is found and how you say which page you expect to be looking at. Keep these in step with
# geometry.h's kPageSizes -- the settings and pedalboard figures here were both stale once, which
# is a comment that silently tells you to look for the wrong window.
#
# The settings figure is the odd one out and is NOT its page size: that page is 1166 units tall and
# scrolls, so it OPENS at kSettingsDefaultViewH and can then be dragged to any height between
# kSettingsMinViewH and the whole page. 524 is the height to look for after a fresh click on the
# gear; after a `resize`, pass whatever you resized it to.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/editor-drive.sh shot out.png
#   scripts/editor-drive.sh click 251 226 shot out.png
#   scripts/editor-drive.sh rclick 320 200 shot out.png         # the second button
#   scripts/editor-drive.sh drag 251 226 0 -70 shot out.png     # photographed mid-drag
#   scripts/editor-drive.sh click 140 110 type "JCM800" key Return shot out.png
#   scripts/editor-drive.sh --size 640x460 click 320 200 shot cab.png
#   scripts/editor-drive.sh click 981 106 resize 640 420 shot short.png   # the settings page,
#                                                                        # short enough to scroll
#   scripts/editor-drive.sh --size 640x420 wheel 320 300 -4 shot down.png
#
# `resize` resizes the HOST's top-level window, which is what makes the host ask the plug-in's
# checkSizeConstraint and then call onSize — resizing the plug-in's child window directly would
# repaint some pixels and tell the editor nothing. After one, pass the new size to --size on the
# next invocation, since that is how the window is found.
#
# Commands are applied in order, so several clicks and shots can be chained in one session. The
# host is started once and torn down at the end.

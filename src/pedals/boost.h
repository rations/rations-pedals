// An Ibanez TS-9 Tube Screamer. Every component value, every equation and both diode parameters
// below are read out of David T. Yeh, "Digital Implementation of Musical Distortion Circuits by
// Analysis and Simulation" (Stanford CCRMA, 2009), section 2.4 — the PDF and a text extract of
// that section are in third_party/refs/pedals, and each constant names the equation or figure it
// comes from. Nothing here is from recollection of how a Tube Screamer works.
//
// TWO FACTS SHAPE EVERYTHING AND NEITHER IS OBVIOUS.
//
// It is NOT a clipper in series with the signal. The clipped copy is SUMMED with the clean input
// (eq. 2.13, V_o = V + V_i), and that summation is most of why the pedal reads as a boost rather
// than as a distortion: however hard the clipped path limits, the clean path goes straight through
// underneath it. A series clipper would not sound like this however well the diodes were modelled.
//
// And the clipping stage is NOT a memoryless curve. The 51 pF feedback capacitor is state, so
// eq. 2.12 is a first-order nonlinear ODE, and its linear pole 1/(R2·Cc) MOVES WITH DRIVE — 61 kHz
// with the pot down, 5.7 kHz with it up — so the pedal darkens as it is driven. A waveshaper
// throws that away, which is why this solves the ODE instead.

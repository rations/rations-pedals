// Two fractional delay lines with a filtered feedback loop, so repeats darken as they go round
// rather than repeating identically forever. Stereo, with a ping-pong mode that crosses the two
// loops. Delay time is smoothed per sample, so dragging Time pitch-bends the repeats the way
// moving a real delay's read head does.
//
// THE STRUCTURE IS A FEEDBACK COMB FILTER, and the reference is Julius O. Smith III, *Physical
// Audio Signal Processing*, "Feedback Comb Filters" — a copy is in third_party/refs/pedals/pasp/.
// Two things are taken from that page directly:
//
//   y(n) = x(n) + g*y(n-M)     "a computational model of a series of echoes, exponentially
//                              decaying and uniformly spaced in time"
//
//   |g| < 1                    the stability condition, stated there as the thing that separates a
//                              decaying series of echoes from "a never-ending, growing series". It
//                              is why the Feedback knob stops at 95 and not at 100, and it is what
//                              tools/pedalcheck's decay measurement asserts.
//
// Smith also notes that the output may be taken "from the end of the delay line instead of the
// beginning", which "merely delays the output signal by M samples". That is the tap this pedal
// uses: the wet signal IS the line read, so the first repeat arrives one delay after the note
// rather than on top of it, which is what a delay pedal is.
//
// WHERE THE LOOP FILTER GOES, and it is the one placement that changes what the pedal sounds like.
// It filters what is WRITTEN to the line — the input and the returning feedback together — so
// repeat n has been through it n times and the darkening is cumulative. That is the analog
// arrangement rather than a convenience: in a bucket-brigade delay the signal passes the
// anti-alias filter on its way INTO the device and the reconstruction filter on its way out, so
// even the first repeat is already duller than the dry. Putting the filter on the feedback return
// only would leave the first repeat a clean copy, which is a digital delay's behaviour.
//
// WHY THE PEDAL DOES NOT MODEL A BBD's FILTER, which is worth writing down because it looks like
// the obvious thing to do. A bucket-brigade device is a discrete-time analog line clocked at
// f_clk, so its usable bandwidth is bounded by f_clk/2, and its delay is stages/(2*f_clk) — which
// means bandwidth and delay time are not independent: bandwidth <= stages/(4*T). The relation is
// confirmed by the two operating points Panasonic's 2048-stage MN3208 is specified at, ~102 ms at
// a 10 kHz clock and ~2 ms at 500 kHz (2048/(2*10e3) = 102.4 ms; 2048/(2*500e3) = 2.048 ms), and
// it is the reason a real analog delay gets darker as it gets longer. Reproduced literally over
// this pedal's 20-2000 ms span it would be unusable: a 2048-stage device set to 2 s would have a
// 512 Hz clock and 256 Hz of bandwidth. That is exactly why long delays went digital, so Tone is
// an ordinary independent control and the darkening does not track the time knob.
//
// Time is in milliseconds and is IGNORED while Sync names a note division; the knob stays live and
// keeps its value, so unsyncing returns to where the player left it. The tempo comes from the
// host's ProcessContext and falls back to free-running when the host supplies none — verified
// against the pristine SDK before a line of it was written: ProcessContext::tempo is documented
// "(optional)" and is only valid when `state & kTempoValid` is set, and the host is not obliged to
// supply a ProcessContext at all (pluginterfaces/vst/ivstprocesscontext.h). Both are checked in
// PedalProcessor::process. A beat is a quarter note, which the SDK states for projectTimeMusic
// ("1.0 equals 1 quarter note") rather than for tempo itself; kDelaySyncBeats is written in those
// terms.

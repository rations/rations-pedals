// A feedforward comb filter whose delay is swept, with feedback around the same delay line. True
// stereo: the two channels run the same LFO 180 degrees apart.
//
// THE STRUCTURE IS JULIUS O. SMITH III'S, *Physical Audio Signal Processing*, chapter 5. Copies of
// every page cited are in third_party/refs/pedals/pasp/.
//
//   "Flanging" (eq. 5.1)      y(n) = x(n) + g*x[n-M(n)], "modeled quite accurately as a
//   Flanging.html             feedforward comb filter ... in which the delay M is varied over
//                             time". And the fact this pedal is measured against: "The notches are
//                             thus spaced at intervals of fs/M Hz ... the notch spacing is
//                             inversely proportional to delay-line length."
//
//   "Flanger Speed and        M(n) = M0*[1 + A*sin(2*pi*f*n*T)] — f the speed, A the excursion, M0
//   Excursion"                the average delay. Manual sets M0, Depth sets A, Rate sets f. The
//                             excursion is a RATIO of M0 rather than a fixed number of
//                             milliseconds, which is Smith's own form and is also the musical one:
//                             notch spacing goes as 1/M, so a fixed ratio sweeps a fixed interval
//                             wherever Manual is set.
//
//   "Flanger Depth Control"   g = 1 for maximum effect, g = 0 for none.
//
//   "Flanger Inverted Mode"   g = -1 trades the peaks and notches. "In practice, the depth control
//                             g is usually constrained to the interval [0,1], and a sign inversion
//                             for g is controlled separately."
//
//   "Flanger Feedback         "Many modern commercial flangers have a control knob labeled
//   Control"                  'feedback' or 'regen.' This control sets the level of feedback from
//                             the output to the input of the delay line, thereby creating a
//                             feedback comb filter in addition to the feedforward comb filter."
//
// TWO DEPARTURES FROM THE EQUATIONS AS WRITTEN, both deliberate.
//
// The output is 0.5*(x + d) rather than eq. 5.1's x + g*x[n-M] with g fixed at 1. The equation's
// form peaks at +6 dB, and this pedal has no output level control, so engaging it would be a
// 6 dB jump. Half of the sum is also the physical picture Smith opens the chapter with — two tape
// machines playing the same tape "with their outputs added together (mixed equally)", Fig. 5.2 —
// so the peaks land at unity and the notches are still true nulls. Being quieter than bypass on
// average is not a defect: a flanger removes energy at its notches, and that is the effect.
//
// The sign lives on REGEN, not on g. Smith puts the inversion on the depth control and says it is
// usually a separate switch; the panel here has a signed Regen knob and no switch, and mda's
// ThruZero (MIT, in the SDK tree) maps its own feedback control the same signed way. A negative
// regen inverts the feedback comb's peaks into notches, which is the same trade of peaks for
// notches the inverted mode describes, reached with one control instead of two.
//
// The parameter RANGES follow the same two references: +-0.95 on regen is mda ThruZero's
// `1.9*p - 0.95`, and 0.5-8 ms of delay is the span DaisySP's flanger sweeps (MIT,
// third_party/DaisySP/Source/Effects/flanger.cpp, ".1 to 7 ms" plus its one-sample offset).

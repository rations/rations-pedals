// rather than in one of those files because the alternative — a `ModDelay` class general enough to
// be both a chorus and a flanger — would be a worse abstraction than the two short loops it
// replaced: the Chorus is two taps on ONE line with no feedback, the Flanger is one tap per channel
// on its OWN line WITH feedback, and a class covering both is mostly branches on which one it is.
//
// The primitives are shared; the topologies are not.
//
// REAL-TIME CONTRACT: only prepare() allocates. reset(), and everything on the per-sample path,

// Turns, because every use of it here asks for the value at some fixed offset from the running
// phase — the Chorus's two taps in quadrature, the Flanger's two channels in antiphase — and an
// offset expressed as 0.25 or 0.5 is checkable by eye where pi/2 and pi are not. It also makes the
// wrap a subtraction of exactly 1.0 rather than of an irrational number, so the phase cannot drift
// by accumulating a rounded 2*pi.
//
// Both shapes are provided because the two pedals want different ones, and which one each wants
// follows from what the ear is actually listening to. See the note in chorus.h.

// would drag the whole NAM core in behind it. Signalsmith's `InterpolatorCubic`
// (third_party/signalsmith-dsp/delay.h) is the same polynomial written a different way, and is the

// WHY CUBIC AND NOT LINEAR, which is what both of the structural references for these two pedals
// use (DaisySP's DelayLine::Read, and mda's ThruZero): linear interpolation of a delay line is a
// lowpass whose corner depends on the FRACTIONAL part of the delay, so a delay that is being
// modulated drags a moving lowpass across the signal. That is inaudible in a chorus and audible in
// a flanger, whose whole business is the depth of a notch at high frequency. The cost of the
// choice is measured rather than assumed — see tools/pedalcheck's interpolator comparison, which
// reports both.

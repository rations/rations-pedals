// Built on deps/wdl/verbengine.h — Cockos' WDL_ReverbEngine, itself derived from Jezar at
// Dreampoint's public-domain Freeverb. Vendored whole and wrapped rather than written, because a
// Schroeder/Moorer reverberator that somebody tuned by listening is worth more than a fresh one
// with the same block diagram, and because a hand-rolled reverb is the easiest thing on this board
// to get subtly wrong. RULES §5's "port, do not re-invent", applied to the one pedal where the
// permissive prior art is not a primitive but the whole effect.
//
// THE REFERENCE IS PASP's "Freeverb" section and the two pages under it — "Freeverb Main Loop" and
// "Lowpass-Feedback Comb Filter" — copies in third_party/refs/pedals/pasp/. Everything this pedal
// decides for itself is decided from what those pages say the engine's own controls MEAN:
//
//   LBCF(N,f,d) = z^-N / (1 - f*(1-d)/(1 - d*z^-1)*z^-N)
//
//     the lowpass-feedback comb filter, one per comb, with a UNITY-GAIN one-pole in the loop:
//     H(z) = (1-d)/(1 - d z^-1). Unity gain at DC is the whole reason the two knobs separate
//     cleanly — see Decay and Tone below.
//
//   f < 1                        required for DC stability, which is what bounds the Decay map.
//
//   "the roomsize parameter can be interpreted as setting the low-frequency T60 ... while the
//   damping parameter controls how rapidly T60 shortens as a function of increasing frequency"
//
//     That sentence is the panel. Decay is the engine's f and Tone is its d, and the sentence is
//     also the GATE: tools/pedalcheck measures T60 in a low band and a high band separately and
//     asserts that Tone moves the second and leaves the first alone. A plain low-pass across the
//     wet output would sound similar on a first listen and would fail that, because it shortens
//     nothing.
//
//   "A lower-limit on T60 is given by the four diffusion allpass filters."
//
//     Which is why the short end of the Decay map is 0.4 s and not 0.05: the allpass chain rings
//     for about 0.13 s whatever f is, so a shorter target would be a knob asking for something the
//     structure cannot deliver.
//
// WDL IS NOT FREEVERB, and the differences are load-bearing rather than cosmetic. It runs TEN
// combs and SIX allpasses per channel where Freeverb has eight and four; it takes the comb
// feedback f directly instead of through Freeverb's `roomsize*0.28 + 0.7` map; and — the one that
// matters most here — it is a TRUE STEREO engine. Freeverb sums its two inputs to mono and feeds
// that to both banks (PASP quotes the loop: `input = (*inputL + *inputR) * gain`); WDL feeds the
// left input to the left bank and the right to the right. A reverb is usually the last thing in a
// chain, so whatever stereo reached it is the stereo the listener gets; summing to mono there
// would undo every widening effect ahead of it.
//
// WIDTH IS FIXED AT 1.0 AND IS NOT ON THE PANEL. In WDL's mixer that is the setting where the left
// output is the left bank and the right output is the right bank, with no cross-feed — PASP's
// `wet2 = 0`, "maximally different left and right reverberation signals". The two banks are
// already detuned against each other by the engine's own `stereospread` of 23 samples, so full
// separation is what makes that detuning audible; anything less is a width control that spends its
// travel undoing the tuning. A pedal with four knobs does not get a fifth for that.
//
// WHERE THE LEVEL COMPENSATION COMES FROM, and it is the one piece of arithmetic this wrapper adds
// to the engine rather than merely configuring. A feedback comb's power gain for a broadband input
// is 1/(1-f^2) — the sum of a geometric series in f^2 over the taps of its impulse response — so
// raising Decay from one end of its range to the other makes the wet signal about 9 dB louder all
// by itself. On a reverb with its own wet fader that is correct and expected; on a pedal whose one
// mix knob has to stay put while the player auditions decay times it is a fault. So the wet is
// scaled by sqrt(1 - f^2), which cancels that growth exactly for the comb bank and leaves the
// endpoints of the Decay knob at the same loudness. Damping is deliberately NOT compensated: a
// damped room IS quieter, that is what absorption does, and Tone would stop being a physical
// control if it were levelled.

// a run of it, and the derivation is short enough to give in full.
//
// For a broadband input the power gain of a filter is the sum of the squares of its impulse
// response. The engine is ten combs in parallel feeding six allpass sections in series:
//
//   comb      after the sqrt(1 - f^2) compensation each contributes exactly 1, and ten of them in
//             parallel have delays that share almost no common multiples, so their cross terms
//             vanish and the powers add: 10.
//
//   allpass   PASP's "Freeverb Allpass Approximation" gives what Freeverb actually implements,
//             which is not an allpass: (-1 + (1+g)z^-N)/(1 - g z^-N). Expanding it, the impulse
//             response is {-1, 1, g, g^2, ...} at taps 0, N, 2N, ..., so its sum of squares is
//             1 + 1/(1 - g^2) = 7/3 at the g = 0.5 the engine fixes. Six in series: (7/3)^3.
//
//   0.015     Freeverb's `fixedgain`, carried into WDL verbatim, applied to the engine's input.
//
// So the raw broadband amplitude gain is 0.015 * sqrt(10) * (7/3)^3 = 0.6025, and this is its
// reciprocal. Measured on the built pedal: 0.5940, which is 1.4 % below the prediction — the
// residual is the tap collisions the "cross terms vanish" step above waves away. tools/pedalcheck
// recomputes the prediction from those structural constants written out again and asserts the

// What converts the T60 the LONGEST comb would give on its own into the T60 a measurement actually
// reports for the whole bank, and it is a property of the ten comb lengths rather than a fudge.
//
// PASP's LBCF analysis gives the decay of ONE comb exactly. A reverb is ten of them at once, with
// lengths spanning 1214 to 1902 samples at 48 kHz, so the early tail is steeper than the late one:
// the short combs are still contributing while the long one sets the asymptote. A T30 fit over the
// standard -5 to -35 dB window therefore lands short of the asymptotic figure, by this much.
//
// It is a CONSTANT rather than a curve, and that is provable rather than lucky. Each comb's energy
// decays as exp(2*t*fs*ln(f)/N_i), so the whole bank's decay curve depends on t and f only through
// the product t*ln(f) — change f and the curve stretches without changing shape, so any fit over
// any fixed dB window scales with it and the ratio is fixed. Computed from the ten lengths and that
// window: 0.8925, and the same value comes out at 44.1, 48 and 96 kHz, which is why this pedal's
// T60 does not depend on the sample rate.
//
// Measured end to end on the built pedal it is 0.884 rather than 0.8925 — 1 % short, drifting from
// 0.887 at the shortest decay to 0.882 at the longest. That residual is not noise, and the
// reference names it: the six diffusion allpasses ring at a FIXED g = 0.5 whatever f is — PASP's
// "a lower-limit on T60 is given by the four diffusion allpass filters" — and a floor that does not
// scale is exactly what breaks the scale invariance above, most at the short end, which is the
// direction the drift goes. 1 % of a decay time is not a thing anyone can hear, so the derived

//
// IT IS MARGIN RATHER THAN NECESSITY, and the measurement says so plainly enough to be worth

// Freeverb's `fixedgain` of 0.015: 36 dB of attenuation before anything can be heard, and what
// survives it is spread across ten comb lengths that are not whole multiples of the block, of this
// chunk, or of each other. tools/pedalcheck tried the faults: snapping Decay, Tone or Pre-delay
// outright — no smoothing at all — is not detectable at this pedal's output by any check in that
// file, and neither is widening this chunk to a whole block. Snapping Mix, which scales the OUTPUT,

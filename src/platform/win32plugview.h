// Win32PlugView — reusable base class for HWND-embedded VST3 plug-in editors.
//
// Implements the kPlatformTypeHWND contract from pluginterfaces/gui/iplugview.h:
// the host passes an HWND (as a void*) to IPlugView::attached(); the plug-in
// creates one WS_CHILD window inside it and paints that window itself.
// Coordinates are physical pixels — the SDK says so explicitly of both
// kPlatformTypeHWND and kPlatformTypeX11EmbedWindowID, which is why the
// geometry and hit-testing above this class need no platform branch.
//
// This is the sibling of X11PlugView and honours exactly the same protected
// hook set, so RationsEditorView compiles against either without knowing which.
// The two differ in one structural way, and it is worth stating plainly because
// it is most of the difference in size between the two files:
//
//   On Linux the plug-in owns no thread and no run loop. It has to borrow the
//   host's Linux::IRunLoop, register an IEventHandler on the X connection's
//   file descriptor to be told when events are readable, register an
//   ITimerHandler for the repaint tick, and unregister both before tearing the
//   window down. On Windows all of that IS the platform: the host pumps
//   messages, the window procedure below is called with them, and the tick is
//   a SetTimer. Nothing is registered with the host and nothing has to be
//   unregistered from it. Linux::IRunLoop does not exist on this platform.
//
// What does NOT change is the deferred-paint discipline. Input messages only
// ever set a dirty flag; the actual draw happens on the next WM_TIMER. Painting
// straight out of an input message is how a plug-in re-enters the host's
// message loop, and it is the classic reason an editor works in one host and
// hangs in another. WM_PAINT blits the last composed frame and never calls
// onDraw().
//
// Drawing is double-buffered through a DIB section: onDraw() paints into a
// Cairo image surface that is backed by the DIB's own pixels, and the DIB is
// blitted to the window with one BitBlt. That is the same shape as the X11
// version's offscreen-image-plus-blit, with one copy fewer, and it is why Cairo
// needs no win32 backend here — only its image backend.
//
// RESIZING. CPluginView::canResize() returns kResultFalse and its
// checkSizeConstraint() is a stub, so a resizable editor has to override all
// three of canResize / checkSizeConstraint / onSize. The size policy itself is
// not hard-coded here — a subclass opts in through isResizable() and states its
// rule in constrainSize(), which both checkSizeConstraint() (the host asking
// "may I?") and onSize() (the host saying "I did") route through, so the two can
// never disagree. Per the SDK's own instruction, the window is resized only
// from onSize().
//
// DPI. IPlugViewContentScaleSupport is implemented here and not on Linux,
// because it exists for exactly this platform — the SDK: "This interface
// communicates the content scale factor from the host to the plug-in view on
// systems where plug-ins cannot get this information directly like Microsoft
// Windows", and "It is recommended to implement this interface on Microsoft
// Windows". A scale factor is turned into a resize of the base size and handed
// back to the host through IPlugFrame::resizeView, which is all a view whose
// layout is resolution-independent has to do.
//
// Subclasses must do all windowing-dependent setup in onAttached() rather than
// in their constructor, so that createView() stays harmless in headless hosts
// (the validator creates and destroys views without ever attaching them).

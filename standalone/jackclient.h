// JackClient — mono-in / stereo-out audio, plus a MIDI in port, for the pedal standalones.
//
// Mono in because a guitar is mono and every one of these pedals accepts a mono input; stereo
// out because four of the five produce stereo from it, and the Boost — which is one circuit and
// mono all the way through — is heard from both speakers rather than one. main.cpp asks the
// plug-in for exactly that arrangement before the component is activated.
//
// The process callback runs on JACK's real-time thread and obeys the same contract the plug-in's
// own process() does: no allocation, no locks, no logging, no file I/O. Every VST3 process
// structure is allocated once in open(); the sample buffers are JACK's own, which the bus pointers
// are aimed at each block rather than copied through.
//
// Three things have to cross the RT boundary, and none of them may touch a lock or the edit
// controller from the audio thread:
//
//   UI -> RT   parameter edits made in the editor. They arrive on the UI thread through the host's
//              IComponentHandler and are pushed into a single-producer/single-consumer ring, which
//              the audio thread drains into the VST3 input parameter queues at the top of each
//              block. Sharing a ParameterChanges between the two threads instead would be a plain
//              data race.
//
//   MIDI -> RT the footswitch. JACK hands its messages to this same callback, and where each one
//              has to go was worked out on the main thread (see midiroute.h) precisely so that
//              nothing here has to ask the controller anything.
//
//   RT -> UI   whatever the plug-in publishes through outputParameterChanges — here, the echo of
//              a parameter it moved by itself. The audio thread only stores them in atomics; the
//              UI thread reads those and calls the controller, because IEditController must
//              never be called from RT.

    // telling it. The reconfiguration is VST3 main-thread work, and it is not done in JACK's

    // --- what the plug-in publishes back ---------------------------------
    // EVERY parameter the processor writes into outputParameterChanges, whatever it is. Forwarding
    // a hand-picked few was the first version of this and it was wrong, in a way that only showed
    // up with a footswitch in hand: the queue carries two different kinds of traffic and only one
    // of them was being read.
    //
    //   * Any hidden read-only parameter a plug-in publishes every block. These pedals publish
    //     none today, and the mechanism is kept because it costs nothing and because a plug-in
    //     that grew one would otherwise be silently unheard.
    //   * An ECHO of any parameter the plug-in changed BY ITSELF, which is what the MIDI learn
    //     row does on the audio thread. A parameter the plug-in moved and did not report leaves
    //     the editor's copy disagreeing with the audio. A host closes that loop by calling
    //     IEditController::setParamNormalized, and the standalone is the host here.
    //
    // Dropping the second kind is a footswitch that changes the sound while the panel says
    // otherwise - the switch stays where it was and the lamp stays dark.
    //
    // Values are COALESCED per parameter id rather than queued, so a parameter that arrives every
    // block cannot crowd out an echo that arrives once. Slots are claimed on the audio thread

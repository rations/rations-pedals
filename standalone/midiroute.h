// MidiRoute — where a MIDI message has to be delivered, worked out once on the main thread.
//
// A DAW does this translation and the standalone is the DAW here, so it has to do it too. The
// three things a footswitch can send do NOT arrive at a VST3 plug-in by the same route and only
// one of them is still MIDI by the time it lands (src/common/midilearn.h documents all three
// against the SDK sites they were verified at):
//
//   * Control Change  -> a PARAMETER change, on the parameter IMidiMapping names for that
//                        controller number. The MIDI channel is gone by then.
//   * Program Change  -> a PARAMETER change too, on the parameter carrying kIsProgramChange in
//                        the unit IUnitInfo::getUnitByBus names for the incoming channel. The
//                        SDK's own converter does exactly this
//                        (public.sdk/source/vst/basewrapper/basewrapper.cpp:794-820, 1203-1223).
//   * Note On / Off   -> an EVENT, in ProcessData::inputEvents, still carrying its channel.
//
// WHY THIS IS A CLASS OF ITS OWN rather than three lines inside the JACK callback: both lookups
// are IEditController calls, and the audio thread may never touch the controller. So every answer
// is resolved here, once, on the main thread before the client is activated, and what the RT
// thread gets afterwards is an array subscript.
//
// A controller that offers neither interface is not an error. The affected route is simply dead
// and the other two still work, which is also what happens in a host.
